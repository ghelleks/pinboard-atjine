comet-pinboard 0.1
================

A child theme of the excellent Pinboard theme.

## Features ##

* uses the body, rather than excerpts, for posts in the grid
* clicking the thumbnail in a grid goes to the post, not the image
* fixed bug in slider: the first slide's title was hidden until the second iteration of the loop. It's now shown.

## Installation ##

The original Pinboard, without which this will not work, is available here:

   http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/pinboard

Once Pinboard is installed, copy this pinboard-atjine directory into the wp-content/themes subdirectory of your Wordpress installation and activate the theme through the Wordpress Admin pages.
